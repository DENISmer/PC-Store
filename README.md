PC Store
Hello!

In this project i improve my C#/SQL skills. This "PC Store" have a simple database (in this folder
<a href="https://github.com/DENISmer/PC-Store/tree/master/PC%20Store%20(SQL)">PC Store</a>) consist of four tables.
This database was created in SSMS18.

MAIN task for me was to create administrator menu. In this chapter you can add, edit and delete all rows in the database =).
After point of entry (Program.cs) creates object of <a href="https://github.com/DENISmer/PC-Store/blob/master/PC%20Store/%D0%90uthorization.cs">authorization.cs</a>.

PS
Almost all SQL requests was created in C#. BE CAREFUL! This project have't input options => this database defenseless to malicious code!
